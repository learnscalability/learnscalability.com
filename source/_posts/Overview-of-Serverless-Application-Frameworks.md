This is a growing document on technologies people use to build serverless websites.


## Available Frameworks

- [serverless/serverless](https://github.com/serverless/serverless) Built on nodejs and formarly know as JAWS, this framework appears to be the most mature, stable and feature full of all those surveyed.
- [MitocGroup/deep-framework](https://github.com/MitocGroup/deep-framework) Developed in nodejs, plenty of features, but with much less adoption.
- [mentum/lambdaws](http://mentum.github.io/lambdaws/) Built in nodejs, this framework is not intended for setting up Lambda powered APIs, it doesnâ€™t have integration with API Gateway. Instead it features SQS support and is intended for offline processing.
- [apex/apex](https://github.com/apex/apex). Written in golang, by the famous TJ Holowaychuck, this framework is popular and stable.
- [exratione/lambda-complex](https://github.com/exratione/lambda-complex). A collection of nodejs-based tools for developing for AWS Lambda.
- [tim-b/grunt-aws-lambda](https://github.com/Tim-B/grunt-aws-lambda). Collection of grunt.js tasks for managing lambda functions in AWS

## Alternatives

- [Iron.io Worker](http://www.iron.io/worker/) supports multiple languages, and offers a containerized environment.
- [Tutum.co](http://tutum.co) is a platform for running container on demand, they got aquired by docker.
- [StackHut.com](https://github.com/StackHut) is a github project, provides similar usage to AWS lambda, only you choose the hosting.
- [hook.io](http://hook.io/) lets you hook a gist script to a webhook, is open source and is built by the awsome Marak Squires of Nodejitsu fame.
- [webscript.io](http://www.webscript.io) cloud workers, handling strictly lua functions.
